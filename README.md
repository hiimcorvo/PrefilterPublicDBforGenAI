# PublicDBforGenAI
Small repo for prepping public databases for use in Generative AI

Assumption: Start with your own .smi file of SMILES from whatever public database of molecules you prefer. There are many ways to create this, so I won't cover how to create this baseline file. This is all you need, just the smiles from the database, to be used for your generative models, which I'll make in the future.
